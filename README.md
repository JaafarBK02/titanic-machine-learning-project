# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
During this Project, I used logistic regression to predict survival on the Titanic dataset.


## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression
- **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle Titanic ML Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

The Titanic dataset is one of the most famous beginner-friendly machine learning datasets. It contains details about passengers such as age, sex, class, and more — and asks us to build a model that can predict survival outcomes.

## 🧠 What I Did

- Cleaned and processed missing data
- Engineered new features:
  1. Age categories: Child / Adult / Aged
  2. Combined class and sex into a single feature
- Visualized patterns in the data (e.g., survival by age, class, and gender)
- Built and evaluated a logistic regression model
- Made predictions on the test set
